 *  \brief The OSnl2OS  Class.
 * 
 * @author Horand Gassmann, Jun Ma, Kipp Martin
 * 
 * \remarks
 * The OSnl2OS class is used for reading an AMPL nl file, 
 * extracting from it the instance along with any options indexed over variables, 
 * constraints, objectives. The latter may, if needed, be merged with the contents
 * of an OSoL file. The processed information is stored into an OSInstance object 
 * and either an OSOption object (if not NULL) or an OSoL string.
