KNOWN BUGS

Here is a list of bugs that have been observed by myself or by others,
but to date have not been corrected.

* This isn't really so much of a bug, but a feature I should add to
  the interface. The iterative callback function (ITERFUNC) does not
  accept as input the current value of the optimization variables. 
  This would probably be very useful to pass back.
