# Define your subversion commit by editing the definition of 
# log_entry, add_list, delete_list, and change_list below:
# 
log_entry="
" 
add_list="
"
delete_list="
"
old_list="
"
#
change_list="
"
#
# log_entry
# The contents of this variable will be used as the log entry for the commit.
#
# add_list
# List of files that will be added to the repository during this commit.
# Do not use add_list to add directories; use the following instead:
# 	svn add --non-recursive dir
# 	svn commit directory -m "adding directory dir" dir
# where dir is replaced by the name of the directory. 
# Then use add_list to add the files within that directory.
#
# delete_list
# List of files that will be deleted from the repository during this commit.
#
# old_list
# List of old file names for files that have already been moved in local copy. 
# The new file names must be in the change_list.
#
# change_list
# List of files that are currently in repository and change during this commit.
