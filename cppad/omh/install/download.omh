$section Download The CppAD Source Code$$
$index download, cppad$$
$index cppad, download$$

$head Purpose$$
CppAD is an include file library and you therefore need the source
code to use it.
This section discusses how to download the different versions of CppAD.

$head Distribution Directory$$
We refer to the CppAD source directory created by the download instruction 
below as the distribution directory.
To be specific, the distribution directory contains the file
$code cppad/cppad.hpp$$.

$head Compressed Tar File$$
These files have been archived with $code tar$$
and compressed with $code gzip$$:

$subhead Current Version$$
The download files below are for the current version of CppAD.

$table
EPL License $pre  $$ $cnext $href%
http://www.coin-or.org/download/source/CppAD/cppad-20130000.2.epl.tgz%
cppad-20130000.2.epl.tgz%$$

cppad-20130000.2.gpl.tgz%$$
$tend

$subhead Release Versions$$
Release versions of the compressed tar files can be found at the
$href%http://www.coin-or.org/download/source/CppAD/%CppAD download page/%$$.
These file have the form
$codei%
	cppad-%yyyymmdd%.%rel%.%lic%.tgz
%$$
where the license code $icode lic$$ 
is $code gpl$$, $code epl$$ or $code cpl$$
($code cpl$$ stands for the Common Public License),
$icode yyyymmdd$$ is the date at which the features
of the program were frozen, and each $icode rel$$ number
corresponds to a bug fix (higher numbers corresponding to more bug fixes).

$subhead Unix File Extraction$$
On unix, you can use the command
$codei%
	tar -xvzf cppad-%version%.%lic%.tgz
%$$
where $icode version$$ either refers to the current version,
or one of the release versions.
This will decompress and extract the CppAD into
the distribution directory $codei%cppad-%version%$$.
To see if this has been done correctly, check for the following file:
$codei%
	cppad-%version%/cppad/cppad.hpp
%$$

$subhead Windows File Extraction$$
If you know how to extract the distribution directory from 
the tar file, just do so. Otherwise, below is one way you can do it.
(Note that if $code 7z.exe$$, $code cmake.exe$$, and $code nmake.exe$$ are you 
your execution path, you will not need to specify their paths below.)

$list number$$
Download and install the open source program
$href%http://www.7-zip.org%$$.
$lnext
In a command window, use the command
$codei%
	%path_to_7-zip%\7z x cppad-%version%.%lic%.tgz
%$$
where $icode path_to_7-zip$$ is the location where
$code 7z.exe$$ was installed.
$lnext
Then execute the command
$codei%
	%path_to_7-zip%\7z x cppad-%version%.%lic%.tar
%$$
$lnext
To see if this has been done correctly, check for the following file:
$codei%
	cppad-%version%\cppad\cppad.hpp
%$$
In addition, you can try the following commands:
$codei%
	mkdir work
	cd work
	%path_to_cmake%\cmake -G "NMake Makefiles" ..
	%path_to_nmake%\nmake check
%$$
$lend


$subhead Install Instructions$$
If you are using an old version of CppAD
You should follow the install instructions in 
the $code doc$$ subdirectory of the distribution directory.


$head Subversion$$

$subhead Limitations$$
This download procedure has the following limitations:
$list number$$
The $href%http://subversion.tigris.org/%subversion%$$ 
program must be installed on your system.
$lnext
No documentation is included by this download procedure,
though it can be build from the source code; see
$cref/install instructions/download/Subversion/Install Instructions/$$ below.
$lnext
Only the 
$href%http://opensource.org/licenses/EPL-1.0%EPL licensed%$$
version of CppAD can be obtained by this download procedure.
$lend

$subhead Current Version$$
To obtain current version of CppAD, execute the following commands
$codei%
	svn export https://projects.coin-or.org/svn/CppAD/trunk %dir%
%$$
To see if this has been done correctly, check for the following file:
$codei%
	%dir%/cppad/cppad.hpp
%$$
We refer to your directory choice $icode dir$$ above 
as the distribution directory.

$subhead Stable Versions$$
Subversion downloads are available for a set of stable versions
(after the specified date, only bug fixes get applied).
The following link will list the available $icode dir$$ values
corresponding to 
$href%https://projects.coin-or.org/CppAD/browser/stable% stable versions%$$.
The following command will download a 
stable version of the CppAD source code:
$codei%
	svn export https://projects.coin-or.org/svn/CppAD/stable/%dir% %dir%
%$$
To see if this has been done correctly, check for the following file:
$codei%
	%dir%/cppad/cppad.hpp
%$$
Note that it will correspond to the most recent release for this stable 
version.

$subhead Release Versions$$
Subversion downloads are available for a set of release versions
(no changes are applied).
The following link will list the available $icode dir$$ values
corresponding to 
$href%https://projects.coin-or.org/CppAD/browser/releases%
	release versions 
%$$.
The following command will download a 
release version of the CppAD source code:
$codei%
	svn export https://projects.coin-or.org/svn/CppAD/releases/%dir% %dir%
%$$
To see if this has been done correctly, check for the following file:
$codei%
	%dir%/cppad/cppad.hpp
%$$

$subhead Install Instructions$$
If you are using subversion to download an old version of CppAD,
you will have to build the documentation to get the corresponding install
instructions.
The documentation for CppAD is built from the source code files using
$href%http://www.seanet.com/~bradbell/omhelp/%OMhelp%$$.
You will need to install the $code omhelp$$ command so that
$codep
	which omhelp
$$
shows it is in your path.
Once you have done this, 
in the distribution directory execute the following command:
$codei%
	./build.sh configure omhelp
%$$.
You will then be able to follow the install instructions in 
the $code doc$$ subdirectory of the distribution directory.
