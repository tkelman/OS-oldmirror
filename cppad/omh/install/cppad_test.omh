$section Running the CppAD Examples and Tests$$

$head Purpose$$
After you configure your system with the 
$cref/cmake command/cmake/CMake Command/$$ you
can run the CppAD example and tests to make sure that 
CppAD functions properly on your system.


$head Run All$$
In the $code work$$ subdirectory of the 
$cref/distribution directory/download/Distribution Directory/$$
execute the command
$codep
	make check
$$
This will build and run all of the tests that are support
by your system and the $cref cmake$$ command options.
If you created $code nmake$$ makefiles, you will have
to use $code nmake$$ instead of $code make$$ in the command above; see
the $cref/generator/cmake/generator/$$ option for the $code cmake$$ command.

$head Subsets$$
It is possible to build and run the following subsets of the 
examples and tests:
$table
Command $cnext 
	Description
$rnext
$code make check_compare_c$$ $cnext 
	$tref compare_c$$ 
$rnext
$code make check_example$$   $cnext 
	most of the $cref Example$$ programs
$rnext
$code make check_introduction$$   $cnext 
	the programs in the $cref Introduction$$
$rnext
$code make check_print_for$$ $cnext 
	the print_for command
$rnext
$code make check_test_more$$ $cnext 
	correctness tests that are not examples 
$rnext
$code make check_multi_thread$$ $cnext 
	$cref multi_thread$$ tests (run correctness only) 
$rnext
$code make check_speed$$ $cnext 
	single threading $cref speed$$ tests (run correctness only)
$rnext
$code make check_ipopt_nlp$$ $cnext
